# How does this differ from LINBIT's LINSTOR?
The containers we provide in the Piraeus project are Debian based and packages get installed from a
PPA. These are maintained at a best effort basis, but make sure to understand the
[differences](https://launchpad.net/~linbit/+archive/ubuntu/linbit-drbd9-stack) between these packages and the
ones provided by LINBIT for its customers.

Additionally, container images provided by LINBIT as commercial offer on [drbd.io](http://drbd.io), are based
on RHEL/UBI images and are for example OpenShift certified.
